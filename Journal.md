# BeltyBoi, a hopefully unseltingly fast belted printer

# Project background

For a while ive been messing arround with 3d printers, i think its 4 years at this pont. Thats quite a while!
And for the last two years ive been enjoy tinkering with the printers more than actually printing, which lead to me making a 3d printer from scratch with infil.
For the printer i made with infil i made a polar 3d printer, and i loved making it, so now i hope to make something maybe more practical but still unconventional

Core XY belted printer, and when i say belted , i mean it prints on a belt, like babybelt.

# Project requirements

- Since im working within a budget of 350 usd i cant go crazy so to try and keep the budget at something reasonable i am going to try and use voron 0 parts like the bed heater ect
	- this should help keep the cost down but also since its smaller it should go faster
- I want this thing to be FAST
	- im thinking maybe nema 17 motors? something like the 2504ac or 2804ah depending on how my budget likes me
